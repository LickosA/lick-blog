My name is Lickos. Cybersecurity and Project Management are what drives me and I aspire to become a **Research Manager**.

This blog is an avenue for me to connect my keen passion for the sharing of knowledge with my love for the internet. On this platform, not only will I be sharing my experiences in the cyberspace, but also, I will be creating contents that will help people thrive both in the cyberspace and in real life.

I hold the view that learning, creating, and sharing are our passport to great achievements and that’s exaclty what we’ll be doing here.
